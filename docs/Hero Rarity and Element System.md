# Hero Rarity and Element System

This system establishes a tiered structure for hero acquisition and elemental power, offering strategic depth to gameplay.

## Rarity

The rarity of a hero directly influences the level of their base element. Here's a breakdown of the rarity system and its impact:

| **Rarity** | Chance to Obtain | Initial Power | **Elemental Level** | **Example**                                                                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Common           | 70% - 80%        | 100           | Level 1                   | Water, Fire, Wind, Earth                                                               |
| Rare             | 30% - 60%        | 500           | Level 2                   | Ice (Water Lv.2), Inferno (Fire Lv.2), Cyclone (Wind Lv.2), Mud (Earth Lv.2)           |
| Epic             | 15% - 20%        | 1000          | Level 3                   | Frost (Water Lv.3), Plasma (Fire Lv.3), Tempest (Wind Lv.3), Sand (Earth Lv.3)         |
| Legendary        | 5% - 8%          | 1500          | Level 4                   | Glacier (Water Lv.4), Phoenix (Fire Lv.4), Hurricane (Wind Lv.4), Rock (Earth Lv.4)    |
| Mythical         | 0.5% - 2%        | 2300          | Level 5                   | Tsunami (Water Lv.5), Supernova (Fire Lv.5), Whirlwind (Wind Lv.5), Titan (Earth Lv.5) |

## Elements

The game features four fundamental elements: **Water, Fire, Wind, and Earth**. Each element progresses through five distinct stages, unlocking progressively powerful forms as heroes ascend in rarity:

| **Element** | **Level 1** | **Level 2** | **Level 3** | **Level 4** | **Level 5** |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Water             | Water             | Ice               | Frost             | Glacier           | Tsunami           |
| Fire              | Fire              | Inferno           | Plasma            | Phoenix           | Supernova         |
| Wind              | Wind              | Cyclone           | Tempest           | Hurricane         | Whirlwind         |
| Earth             | Earth             | Mud               | Sand              | Rock              | Titan             |

## Elemental Counters

Strategic depth is introduced through elemental counters. Each element has a specific opposing element it is weak against, allowing players to exploit vulnerabilities and deal bonus damage during combat:

* **Water** counters **Earth**
* **Fire** counters **Water**
* **Wind** counters **Fire**
* **Earth** counters **Wind**

For example, a Water (Level 2) hero would inflict bonus damage on an Earth (Level 1) hero due to the elemental counter system.

This system encourages players to consider elemental matchups when building their teams and choosing targets in combat, adding a layer of strategic complexity to the gameplay experience.

## Hero Roles and Categories

Heroes are further categorized based on their primary role and combat function:

**Roles:**

* **Healer:** Provides support to allies through healing spells and buffs.
* **Damage Dealer:** Focuses on inflicting high damage to enemies.
* **Tank:** Absorbs damage and protects allies from harm.
* **Support:** Offers various utility functions such as crowd control, buffs, and debuffs.

**Categories:**

Each role can be further divided into specific categories that reflect the hero's playstyle and abilities. For example, Healers might be categorized as **Enchanters** or **Priests**, while Damage Dealers could be **Sorcerers** or **Archers,** and **Guardian** as a Tank

This system allows players to choose heroes that not only complement their elemental strategy but also fulfill specific tactical needs within their team composition.
